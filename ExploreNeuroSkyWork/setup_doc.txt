neuropy = NeuroPy.NeuroPy("COM6", 57600)

def attention_callback(attention_value):
	"""this function will be called everytime NeuroPy has a new value for attention"""
	print("Value of attantion is: ", attention_value)
	return None

neuropy.setCallBack("attention", attention_callback)
neuropy.start()

try:
